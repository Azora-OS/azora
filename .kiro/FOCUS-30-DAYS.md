# 🎯 FOCUS: Next 30 Days

## THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS

Get 10 students learning Python during load shedding.

Everything else is noise.

## THE EXECUTION (This Week)

### Day 1-2: Test PWA Locally
```bash
cd apps/student-portal
npm run dev
# Test:
# 1. Sign up as student
# 2. Take a lesson
# 3. Go offline (airplane mode)
# 4. Verify it still works
# 5. Go online
# 6. Verify sync works
```

### Day 3: Deploy to Teraco
- Get Teraco server (R500-R1000/month)
- Deploy PWA
- Test from mobile phone
- Verify offline mode works

### Day 4: Post on LinkedIn
```

✅ Works OFFLINE (load shedding proof)
✅ Uses < 20MB data (R1.50/week)
✅ Works on old phones/laptops
✅ FREE to start
✅ Earn while you learn

Built for SA reality. Not Silicon Valley fantasy.

✅ Next 50 students on waitlist

## WHAT DOESN'T MATTER (YET)

❌ Knowledge Ocean
❌ Search engine
❌ Advanced AI
❌ The Citadel
❌ Perfect code
❌ 100% test coverage
❌ Fancy features

## THE RULE

If it doesn't help get 10 students learning Python this week, DON'T DO IT.

## AFTER 30 DAYS

Once we have 10 successful students:
- Scale to 50 students
- Get first businesses profitable
- Build Development Fund
- THEN think about Knowledge Ocean

Once we have 100 businesses:
- Build Knowledge Ocean
- Add search engine
- Advanced AI features

Once we have R10M Development Fund:
- Plan The Citadel
- Physical campus
- Research center

## THE MANTRA

One step at a time.
Prove each step works.
Then scale.
