## ARCHITECTURAL OVERVIEW

```
KNOWLEDGE SOURCES → INGESTION → [CCF] → PROCESSING → KNOWLEDGE GRAPH → DISTRIBUTION
     ↓                ↓         ↓        ↓             ↓                ↓
African Content   Web Scrapers [FILTER] Cultural Proc  Vector Database  Education APIs
Global Knowledge  API Connectors [BIAS]  Quality Check  Semantic Index  LMS Integration
Research Papers   File Parsers  [CONST] Multi-Language Metadata Store  Student Portals
```

**[CCF] = Constitutional Compliance Filter - MANDATORY ETHICAL GATE**

## CORE COMPONENTS

### 1. INGESTION LAYER
- Web scrapers for African universities
- API connectors for educational databases  
- File processors (PDF, multimedia)
- Raw content normalization

### 2. CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLIANCE FILTER (CCF) - **CRITICAL STAGE**
**Position**: Immediately after ingestion, before any processing
**Purpose**: Mandatory ethical filtering and constitutional validation

#### CCF Filter Logic:

**A. BIAS DETECTION ENGINE**
- Racial bias pattern recognition
- Cultural stereotype identification
- Gender/age discrimination detection
- Colonial narrative flagging
- Score: 0-100 (>80 = REJECT)

**B. MISINFORMATION SCORING**
- Source credibility assessment (academic, government, verified)
- Fact-checking against trusted African databases
- Citation quality validation
- Temporal accuracy verification
- Score: 0-100 (<70 = REJECT)

**C. CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION CHECKER**
- African Sovereignty principles validation
- Ethical Development alignment check
- Cultural sensitivity assessment
- Ubuntu philosophy compliance
- Binary: PASS/FAIL (FAIL = IMMEDIATE REJECT)

#### CCF Decision Matrix:
```
Bias Score < 80 AND Misinformation Score > 70 AND Constitutional Check = PASS
→ PROCEED TO PROCESSING

ANY FAILURE → QUARANTINE + HUMAN REVIEW
```

### 3. PROCESSING PIPELINE (Post-CCF)
- Cultural context analyzer (11 SA languages)
- Quality enhancement engine
- Multi-language processor
- Semantic enrichment

### 4. KNOWLEDGE GRAPH
- Vector database for embeddings
- Semantic indexing system
- Relationship mapping
- Metadata storage

### 5. DISTRIBUTION LAYER
- Education service APIs
- Personalization engine
- Cultural adaptation
- Access control

## CONSTITUTIONAL COMPLIANCE

- **African Sovereignty**: African sources prioritized
- **Cultural Preservation**: Indigenous knowledge protected
- **Quality Assurance**: 95%+ accuracy validation
- **Ethical Processing**: Bias detection and correction

## TECHNICAL SPECS
