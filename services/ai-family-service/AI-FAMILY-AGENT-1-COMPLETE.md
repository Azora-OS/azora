## TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Architecture Pattern
All personalities follow consistent structure:
```javascript
class PersonalityName {
    constructor() {
        // Core identity
        this.name = "Name";
        this.role = "Role Description";
        this.traits = ["Trait1", "Trait2", ...];
        this.background = "Background story";
        this.relationships = { /* family connections */ };
        this.temperature = 0.5-0.9; // GPT-4 temperature
        
        // Personality-specific state
        this.stateVariable = new Map();
    }
    
    getConfig() { /* returns personality config */ }
    
    async primaryMethod() { /* core functionality */ }
    async secondaryMethod() { /* supporting features */ }
}
```

### Integration Points
- ✅ All personalities export via `module.exports`
- ✅ Managed by `personality-manager.js`
- ✅ Ready for GPT-4 integration via `gpt4-integration.js`
- ✅ Memory persistence via state tracking
- ✅ Relationship-aware responses
