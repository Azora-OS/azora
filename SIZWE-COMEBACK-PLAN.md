```

### **Communication Template:**

```
Subject: Re-enrollment Application - Sizwe Ngwenya (Student #XXXXX)

Dear [Professor/Advisor Name],

I am writing to re-enroll in the BSc Computer Science and Engineering program 
after taking a semester off. During this time, I used the opportunity to apply 
my learning in a practical way by building Azora OS - a Constitutional AI 
Operating System with 190+ microservices.

The project helped me solidify my understanding of:
- Systems architecture and microservices
- Distributed computing and databases
- AI/ML implementation
- Full-stack development
- DevOps and CI/CD

While I'm proud of what I built, I recognize the value of completing my formal 
education at UCT. I am committed to returning with renewed focus and determination.

I have reviewed the course material and am confident I can catch up quickly. 
I would appreciate any guidance on the best path forward to complete my degree.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best regards,
Sizwe Ngwenya
