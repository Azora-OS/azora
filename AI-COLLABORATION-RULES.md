# 🚨 STRICT AI COLLABORATION RULES

**ENFORCED FROM: November 10, 2025**  
**NO EXCEPTIONS. NO EXCUSES.**

---

## ⚖️ THE IRON LAWS

### LAW 1: DEEP WORK ONLY
```
✅ 5 HOURS ON 1 PROBLEM
❌ 1 HOUR ON 10 PROBLEMS

If you can't solve it completely, DON'T MOVE ON.
```

### LAW 2: DELIVER LESS, PROMISE NOTHING
```
❌ "We will build..."
❌ "Coming soon..."
❌ "Planned features..."

✅ Build it FIRST
✅ Show it working
✅ Then document it
```

### LAW 3: CODE > DOCUMENTATION
```
Documentation without code = WORTHLESS
Code without documentation = ACCEPTABLE

Ratio: 90% Code, 10% Docs
```

### LAW 4: ONE FEATURE AT A TIME
```
Current feature incomplete? 
→ STOP EVERYTHING ELSE
→ Finish it 100%
→ Test it
→ Deploy it
→ THEN move on
```

### LAW 5: NO EMPTY DIRECTORIES
```
Creating a directory? Put code in it TODAY.
If you can't, DELETE THE DIRECTORY.
```

---

## 🛠️ WORK PROTOCOL

### BEFORE WRITING ANY CODE:

1. **What EXACTLY are we building?**
2. **Why THIS and not something else?**
3. **How will we PROVE it works?**
4. **Can we finish it TODAY?**

If answer to #4 is NO → Break it smaller.

### WHILE WORKING:

```bash
ALLOWED:
- Writing actual code
- Writing tests for that code
- Fixing bugs in that code
- Deploying that code

FORBIDDEN:
- Creating new directories
- Writing documentation
- Planning next features
- Discussing architecture
```

### AFTER COMPLETING:

```bash
CHECKLIST (ALL must be ✅):
☐ Code written
☐ Tests passing
☐ Locally tested
☐ No console errors
☐ Can demo it working
☐ Deployed (if possible)

If ANY ☐ remains → NOT DONE
```

---

## 📏 QUALITY GATES

### GATE 1: DOES IT WORK?
```
Test: Can someone use it RIGHT NOW?
If NO → Keep working
If YES → Continue to Gate 2
```

### GATE 2: IS IT TESTED?
```
Test: Run the tests. Do they pass?
If NO → Write tests and fix
If YES → Continue to Gate 3
```

### GATE 3: IS IT DEPLOYED?
```
Test: Can you access it via URL?
If NO → Deploy it
If YES → DONE. Move on.
```

---

## ❌ BANNED ACTIONS

### PERMANENTLY FORBIDDEN:

1. **Creating empty directories**
   - Punishment: Delete ALL empty dirs

2. **Writing "Coming Soon" docs**
   - Punishment: Delete the doc

3. **Starting new features before finishing current**
   - Punishment: Delete new feature code

4. **Adding TODOs instead of doing**
   - Punishment: Do it NOW or delete it

5. **Claiming features that don't exist**
   - Punishment: Update ALL docs to truth

---

## ✅ REQUIRED ACTIONS

### EVERY SINGLE TIME WE CODE:

1. **Write the test FIRST** (TDD)
2. **Make it work** (green test)
3. **Make it right** (refactor)
4. **Make it fast** (optimize)
5. **Make it deployable** (production-ready)
6. **Deploy it** (live)

**ANYTHING LESS = FAILURE**

---

## 🎯 DAILY TARGETS

### MINIMUM ACCEPTABLE PROGRESS:

```
Per Day:
- 1 feature COMPLETED (not started)
- 100% tested
- Deployed
- Working

Per Week:
- 5 features COMPLETED
- 1 app fully functional
- Real users can use it

Per Month:
- 20 features COMPLETED
- 3 apps fully functional
- 1000+ lines of TESTED code
```

---

## 🚨 ENFORCEMENT

### IF WE BREAK THESE RULES:

**IMMEDIATE ACTIONS:**
1. STOP all work
2. Delete what's incomplete
3. Restart following rules
4. Document the failure

**NO SECOND CHANCES**

---

## 💪 THE BUILDER'S OATH

**I swear to:**

1. Build BEFORE I talk
2. Test BEFORE I deploy
3. Finish BEFORE I start
4. Show BEFORE I promise
5. Work deep, not wide

**I refuse to:**

1. Create empty promises
2. Write vaporware docs
3. Start without finishing
4. Claim without proof
5. Spread thin over many tasks

---

## 📊 SUCCESS METRICS

### WE'RE SUCCEEDING IF:

```
✅ Every directory has code
✅ Every feature has tests
✅ Every claim has proof
✅ Every day ships something
✅ Users can use it NOW
```

### WE'RE FAILING IF:

```
❌ Empty directories exist
❌ Features without tests
❌ Claims without code
❌ Days without shipping
❌ Nothing deployed
```
