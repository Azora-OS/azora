Status: ❌ NOT IMPLEMENTED
Impact: No security on any endpoint
Required: JWT, RBAC, session management
Timeline: Week 1-2
```

**2. Frontend Connection (CRITICAL)**
```
Status: ❌ NOT CONNECTED
Impact: 23 beautiful UIs with no data
Required: API client library, data fetching
Timeline: Week 2-3
```

**3. Real AI Integration (HIGH)**
```
Status: ⚠️ FALLBACK MODE
Impact: AI not using real intelligence
Required: OpenAI GPT-4 integration
Timeline: Week 4-5
```

**4. Service Implementation (MEDIUM)**
```
Status: ❌ 141 PLACEHOLDERS
Impact: Limited functionality
Required: Phased implementation
Timeline: Week 6-16
```
