# TODO

- The `package-lock.json` files have been removed. Please run `npm install` to regenerate them.
- The repository size has been significantly reduced, but there may still be opportunities for further optimization. Consider using a tool like `git-filter-repo` to remove large files from the git history.
- The `apps`, `services`, `packages`, and `core` directories are still quite large. A review of the assets and dependencies in these directories could lead to further size reductions.
- The project's dependencies should be audited to identify and remove any unused packages.
