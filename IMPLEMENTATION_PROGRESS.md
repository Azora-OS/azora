  - Validation logic for learning activities
  - Dynamic reward calculation based on difficulty, score, engagement
  - Cryptographic proof hashing

- ✅ Token Minter (`engines/token-minter.js`)
  - Supply management (1B max supply)
  - Halving mechanism every 210K blocks
  - Transaction tracking
  - Inflation calculation
  - Block-based minting

- ✅ Wallet Manager (`engines/wallet-manager.js`)
  - Multi-currency support (AZR, BTC, ETH, USD)
  - Balance management
  - Transfer functionality
  - Transaction history
  - Unique address generation

**What Works:**
```javascript
// Mine tokens from learning activities
const result = await miningEngine.mine('user123', {
  type: 'COURSE_COMPLETION',
  userId: 'user123',
  timestamp: new Date(),
  metadata: { difficulty: 'advanced', score: 95 }
});
// Returns: { success: true, reward: 300, transaction: {...} }

// Check wallet balance
const balance = walletManager.getBalance('user123');
// Returns: { AZR: 300, BTC: 0, ETH: 0, USD: 0 }
```

**Next Steps:**
- Integrate with database (Prisma)
- Add blockchain ledger persistence
- Implement UBI distribution
- Connect to payment gateways

### 3. Azora Sapiens - AI Tutoring (Priority 1)

**Status:** 🔄 PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED

**Components Completed:**
- ✅ Tutor Engine (`src/engines/tutor-engine.ts`) - Already existed with OpenAI integration
- ✅ Learning Path Generator (`src/engines/learning-path-generator.ts`)
  - AI-powered curriculum generation
  - Adaptive learning paths
  - Progress-based adaptation
  - Personalized step-by-step plans

**What Works:**
```typescript
// Generate personalized learning path
const path = await learningPathGenerator.generatePath({
  subject: 'Python Programming',
  currentLevel: 'beginner',
  targetLevel: 'advanced',
  timeframe: 12
});
// Returns: Structured learning path with steps, milestones, resources
```

**Next Steps:**
- ✅ Assessment Engine - EXISTS, needs enhancement
- Progress Tracker - needs database integration
- Interactive simulations - needs implementation
- Connect to course content database

---

### 4. Azora Forge - Marketplace (Priority 2)

**Status:** ✅ BASIC IMPLEMENTATION EXISTS

**Components Completed:**
- ✅ Job Matcher (`index.js`) - Already implemented
- ✅ Skills Assessor - Already implemented
- ✅ In-memory storage for jobs, applications, users

**What Works:**
- Job posting and retrieval
- Application submission
- Skills assessment
- AI-powered job matching (basic algorithm)

**Next Steps:**
- Migrate to database (Prisma)
- Enhance matching algorithm with ML
- Add escrow system
- Implement dispute resolution

## 🔄 In Progress

### Database Schemas (Priority 1)

**Status:** 🔄 NEEDS COMPREHENSIVE UPDATE

**Current State:**
- Individual service schemas exist but are incomplete
- No unified schema across services
- Missing models for many features

**Required Actions:**
1. Create comprehensive Prisma schema for each service:
   - ✅ ai-family-service (needs Conversation, Message models)
   - ✅ azora-mint (needs Wallet, Transaction, MiningActivity models)
   - ✅ azora-sapiens (needs LearningPath, Progress, Assessment models)
   - azora-forge (needs Job, Application, SkillProfile models)
   - azora-education (needs Course, Enrollment, Content models)

2. Add seed data for testing
3. Create migration scripts

---

## ❌ Not Started (High Priority)

### 1. Service Integration - Azora Nexus Event Bus
- No inter-service communication implemented
- Services operate in isolation
- Need event-driven architecture

### 2. Frontend Integration
- Backend services not connected to UIs
- API client libraries are templates
- No real data flow

### 3. Authentication & Authorization
- Auth service exists but not integrated
- No JWT implementation across services
- Missing role-based access control

### 4. Mobile Applications
- React Native setup exists
- No functional app code
- Missing offline capabilities

## 📝 Notes

**Key Insight:** The codebase had extensive documentation but minimal functional code. This implementation phase focuses on:
1. Building working engines first
2. Database integration second
3. Service communication third
4. Frontend connection last

**Philosophy:** "Working code over comprehensive docs" - We're building the house, not just the blueprints.
