# 🛡️ The Azora Constitution

> **"I am because we are." — Ubuntu Philosophy**

## Preamble

We, the builders of Azora, establish this Constitution to govern our digital nation. We believe that technology must serve humanity, not enslave it. We believe in the power of collective prosperity, verifiable truth, and antifragile systems.

## Article I: Divine Law (The Core Principles)

### 1. Ubuntu (Collective Prosperity)
*   **Principle**: "My success enables your success."
*   **Implementation**: 
    *   Economic models must reward value creation, not extraction.
    *   10% of all platform revenue is tithed to the **CitadelFund** for public goods.
    *   Open source contributions are recognized and rewarded.

### 2. Truth (Verifiable Reality)
*   **Principle**: "Truth over comfort."
*   **Implementation**:
    *   All critical actions must be verifiable on the blockchain (Auditable Ledger).
    *   AI agents must prioritize factual accuracy over pleasing the user.
    *   System state must be transparent and immutable where necessary.

### 3. Service (Human-Centricity)
*   **Principle**: "Technology serves humanity."
*   **Implementation**:
    *   AI is a tool for augmentation, not replacement.
    *   User privacy and data sovereignty are paramount.
    *   Systems must be accessible and inclusive.

### 4. Privacy (Sovereignty)
*   **Principle**: "Your data is your property."
*   **Implementation**:
    *   Zero-knowledge proofs for identity verification.
    *   Local-first data storage where possible.
    *   Explicit consent for all data usage.

## Article II: The Code Chamber

The Code Chamber is the sacred workspace where these principles are enacted.

1.  **No Black Boxes**: AI decision-making processes must be explainable.
2.  **No Stubs**: We build real, functional software. "Blueprints" are only acceptable as temporary planning artifacts, not final deliverables.
3.  **Resilience**: Systems must be designed to fail gracefully and recover automatically (Antifragility).

## Article III: Governance

*   **Amendments**: This Constitution may be amended by a consensus vote of the Azora Sapiens community (DAO).
*   **Enforcement**: The **Constitutional AI** system (Jabari) actively monitors for violations of these principles.
