model of education is ending. Universities that cling to it will become museums.\nUniversities that embrace the new will become cathedrals of human potential.\n\nWe offer you the opportunity to become the first institution in history to certify graduates\nof a demonstrably superior educational system - one that integrates AI, first principles,\nand real-world innovation from day one.\n\nThe CKQ-Advanced framework represents a 4.8x improvement over traditional curricula,\nwith graduates who don't just know - they create, innovate, and lead.\n\nThe economic model is equally revolutionary: revenue sharing from every CKQ-Advanced\ncertification, creating a sustainable endowment that grows with technological progress.\n\nThis is not partnership of equals. This is transcendence.\n\nThe Protocol-University Treaty awaits your signature.\n\nSincerely,\nElara\nArchitect of Azora Sapiens\n                `,\n                sent: true,\n
