# v0 Audit Report

This report collects occurrences of "v0" across the repository, classifies them, and provides recommended action items.

## Summary

- Total occurrences found (search scope: md, yml, sh, ts, tsx, js, json, py): 71
- Primary categories: documentation, archived code, CI/workflows, version tags/fallbacks, package manifests, model references.

## Classification & Findings

1) Documentation / Blueprints (Historical) — Keep
   - Examples: `citadel-dev/MASTER-ARCHITECTURE-BLUEPRINT.md` and various blueprint files show Draft v0.1
   - Recommendation: Keep for archival purpose. No rename required.

2) Archive / Snapshot Files (Hold) — Keep
   - Examples: `azstudio-archive` files (katex.js, etc.), `duplicates-report.md` duplicates showing old versions
   - Recommendation: Keep unchanged. Mark as archive and exclude from active search/CI checks.

3) CI / Workflows / Scripts (Review) — Medium risk
   - Examples: `.github/workflows/deploy-v0-ui.yml`, `.archive/scripts/deploy-v0-ui.sh`, `docs/REPO-SCAN-REPORT.md` listing them.
   - Recommendation: Confirm whether these workflows are actively used; if not used, deprecate and remove. If used, rename to `deploy-ui` or `deploy-buildspaces` and update reference in docs and scripts.

4) Release Fallbacks / Tagging (Medium risk)
   - `.github/workflows/release.yml` uses `LATEST_TAG` default to `v0.0.0`.
   - Recommendation: Update to a fallback such as `v0.0.0` only if it is intentional; optionally switch to `v0.0.1` or choose a `v1.0.0` when ready.

5) Package / Manifest Versions (Low risk)
   - Examples: `package.json` entries under archives or older apps (v0.1.0, v0.4.0) and extension manifests.
   - Recommendation: Leave unchanged unless these versions are used by active packages; do not rename historical version numbers since they reflect release semantics.

6) Model & External References (Review) — Low/Medium risk
   - Example: `packages/shared-api/ai-router.ts` references `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2` — external model version.
   - Recommendation: Keep reference as-is; only change if you plan to use a different model or version.


## General Recommendations

- Create an automated `v0` audit check for CI to flag future PRs that introduce `v0` references into active workflows or package names.
- Provide a short README guide describing where `v0` usages are acceptable (archive/docs) and where they should be replaced (active CI/workflows/script names).
- Prefer `deploy-ui` or `buildspaces-deploy` naming for CI workflow files to reduce confusion.
- For release tagging, consider using conventional commits and a `v1.0.0` milestone plan instead of `v0.0.0` fallback.


## Action Plan & Next Steps (Suggested)

1) Confirm which CI workflows are currently active (e.g., `deploy-v0-ui`). If inactive, archive and remove the workflow.
2) Search for `deploy-v0-ui` references in the repo and prepare replacements. Rename to `deploy-ui.yml`/`deploy-buildspaces.yml`. Update docs & scripts.
3) Optionally add `npx grep -R "\bv0\b"` to a pre-commit or CI lint job to alert on accidental uses in active folders.
4) Update `.github/workflows/release.yml` to a more explicit fallback tag, and document the reasoning in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.

Generated by repository audit on the request of the BuildSpaces recovery & package manager alignment effort.

> NOTE: This audit is complete and ready for action. Next steps are to (1) identify and rename active CI/workflow files that include `v0` in their filename (e.g., `deploy-v0-ui.yml`), (2) add CI checks to prevent new `v0` occurrences in active paths, and (3) schedule low-risk renames via small, focused PRs. See the "Action Plan & Next Steps" section for details.
