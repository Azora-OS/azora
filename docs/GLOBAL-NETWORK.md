# Azora Global Network

The Azora Global Network is a decentralized, peer-to-peer network that connects all Azora services and applications. It is built on top of a custom blockchain, the Azora Chain, and is designed to be highly scalable, secure, and resilient.

The network is composed of a number of different types of nodes, including:

* **Gateway nodes:** These nodes are responsible for routing traffic between the Azora network and the public internet.
* **Storage nodes:** These nodes are responsible for storing data on the Azora Chain.
* **Compute nodes:** These nodes are responsible for running applications and services on the Azora network.

All nodes in the Azora network are rewarded for their participation with Azora Coins, the native cryptocurrency of the Azora ecosystem.

The Azora Global Network is still under development, but it has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with the internet. By creating a decentralized, peer-to-peer network, Azora is building a more secure, resilient, and equitable internet for everyone.
