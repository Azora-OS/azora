# Azora OS Project Summary

## High-Level Overview

The Azora OS project is a comprehensive ecosystem designed to revolutionize education and economic empowerment. It is built around the concept of a "Living University" and a "planetary economic intelligence." The project is comprised of several interconnected applications and services that work together to create a seamless user experience.

## Core Philosophy

*   **Sentient Simplicity:** Complex AI and biological architectures are presented with clarity and elegance.
*   **Constitutional Transparency:** The UI provides clear feedback on governance, compliance, and ethical AI operations.
*   **Biological Responsiveness:** The UI is designed to feel alive and adaptive, with self-optimizing and resilient features.
*   **Value-Centric Engagement:** Every interaction is framed around clear value exchange, primarily through the "Proof-of-Knowledge" and "Proof-of-Contribution" models.
*   **African Context, Global Reach:** The project is universally accessible, multilingual, and culturally aware.
