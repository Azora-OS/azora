## 🎨 DESIGN SYSTEM INTEGRATION

### Design Tokens Available Everywhere
```typescript
// Every service now has access to:
import { 
  AZORA_GEM_COLORS,
  SAPPHIRE_COLORS,
  EMERALD_COLORS,
  RUBY_COLORS,
  UBUNTU_COLORS,
  getGemColor,
  getUbuntuSpacing
} from '../design-tokens'
```

### Infrastructure Components
```typescript
// Infrastructure-aligned components
import { INFRASTRUCTURE_DESIGN_TOKENS } from '../design-tokens'

<div style={{ 
  padding: INFRASTRUCTURE_DESIGN_TOKENS.servicePadding 
}}>
```

### Design Configs
```json
// Each service has design.config.json
{
  "designSystem": {
    "tokens": "../../apps/azora-ui/lib/design-system/azora-gem-tokens",
    "components": "../../apps/azora-ui/components/ui"
  },
  "compliance": {
    "enabled": true,
    "autoFix": true
  }
}
```
