  "summary": "Remote code execution vulnerability in azora-core package",
  "details": "A critical remote code execution vulnerability was discovered in the azora-core package. The vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code through specially crafted input to the `executeCommand` function. This occurs due to improper input validation and sanitization in the command processing module.\n\nThe vulnerability affects versions 1.0.0 through 1.2.2 of the azora-core package. Users are strongly advised to upgrade to version 1.2.3 or later which contains the security fix.\n\nIn a typical attack scenario, an attacker could craft malicious input that bypasses the existing validation checks and results in execution of arbitrary system commands with the privileges of the running process.",
