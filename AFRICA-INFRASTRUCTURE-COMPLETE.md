### 2. Roots by the Rivers ✅
**River Data Flows** (`river-flows.ts`)
- ✅ 5 river flows initialized
  - User Activity River
  - Learning Progress River
  - Financial Transactions River
  - AI Insights River
  - System Events River
- ✅ Streaming data infrastructure
- ✅ Event routing
- ✅ Flow metrics
- ✅ Network status

### 3. Networks of Mycelium ✅
**Mycelium Network Layer** (`mycelium-network.ts`)
- ✅ 10 service nodes interconnected
- ✅ Mesh network topology
- ✅ Message propagation
- ✅ Health monitoring
- ✅ Network topology tracking

### 4. Tree Structure ✅
**Tree Architecture** (`tree-architecture.ts`)
- ✅ 4 roots (data, compute, storage, network)
- ✅ Branches mapped to CDN regions
- ✅ Root connections (rivers)
- ✅ Infrastructure integration
- ✅ Complete status monitoring

## 🔗 INTEGRATION

All layers connected:
- **Tree** → Connects CDN, Rivers, Mycelium
- **CDN** → Provides branches across Africa
- **Rivers** → Flow data through roots
- **Mycelium** → Interconnects all services
